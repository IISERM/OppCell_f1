    <div id="faqcontent">
        <p class="c4"><span class="c5">1. Summer internships (academic)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">1. </span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">In I.I.S.E.R., a good recommendation is given only to students who have a good CPI, in general. I don&rsquo;t have a good CPI, so what should I do?</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c10 c0">It may be a good idea to interact with the faculty member from whom you seek a recommendation well in advance. The best way would be to work with her/him and display your</span><span class="c0 c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c0">potential so that when she/he recommends you they will have other parameters to judge you on. In general for applications, having a CPI &gt;8 helps</span><span class="c10 c0">. </span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c10 c0">In general, otherwise, you have several alternatives which may not require a recommendation. If you are seriously interested in a certain field and have pursued ongoing research in it regularly enough, you can apply to the lab whose research you are interested in with a well-written research proposal. Since you need to counter the only other academic performance parameter (your CPI), the research proposal should be thorough and should reflect your serious interest in the same. </span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c9 c0">Biology</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">2. What are the opportunities in Molecular Biology and genetics, in the field of Academia? (MS10086) </span><span class="c9 c0">FORWARD TO PG</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c10">Doubtful answer - </span><span class="c12 c10">There are several labs that use molecular biology and genetics as a tool for research in other fields. These are more tools, and less isolated fields of research. You will need to either look specifically for labs that are dedicated to developing these tools further, or you can apply to a lab that uses these for some applicative research. Rest assured, you will learn a lot in either.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">2.</span><span class="c3 c8">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c12">MS11002- Determined to take Mathematics. Highly like to play with numbers so want to pursue Number theory, Probability, Data analysis Techniques. In second semester I found Analysis interesting so did last summer in Analysis. Now want to do a summer in Number theory outside IISER like CMI, TIFR or ISI, but I got &lsquo;F&rsquo; in three subjects in second semester and my CPI is below 5. So should I go out for this summer or should I repeat those courses in summer. I have got &lsquo;D&rsquo; in First semester and &lsquo;B&rsquo; in second semester in mathematics and this semester surely I will get &lsquo;A&rsquo;. Is there any chance to get project outside IISER with this CPI??</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If my CPI is below 5, should I go out for summer?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c10 c0">This is a personal decision, so we can&rsquo;t comment. In general, the summer projects can help you develop new interests or to deepen your knowledge of a field you are interested. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c10 c0">On the other hand, improving your F grades would increase your CPI, which is at times an important factor in helping you pursue your interests. Also, it is mandatory to have a CPI of 5 to graduate.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">2.5. If my CPI is &lt;6, should I go out for summer?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Yes and No. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c10 c0">No, if you don&rsquo;t have good grades in the subject you wish to pursue further. Then use &nbsp;the summer to gain </span><span class="c6 c10 c0">basic</span><span class="c6 c10 c0">&nbsp;knowledge in the same, and strengthen your concepts, either with the help of faculty members at IISER Mohali, or otherwise.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c10 c0">Yes, if you have decent grades in your subject of interest and want to use the summer to explore them. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">3. &nbsp;Where can we pursue summer internships? Where can we find information regarding the same?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">Please refer to </span><span class="c5">(link)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">4.</span><span class="c3 c8">&nbsp; </span><span class="c12">I am in second year student. Is it a good idea to do a summer in an alien topic or relatively known topic?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">That would be a judgement call. Some people use their summer to explore various fields or sub disciplines within a given field in order to find their area of interest. On the other hand, if you have decided what you want to do, then use the summer to specialize in the field. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c0">Physics</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">5. I want to pursue my career in mathematical physics and major in physics. How can I use the summer internships to my advantage?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">It would be advisable to work for a summer with a mathematical physicist in order to get greater exposure. At IISER Mohali, KP Yogendran does this work and departments at various research institutes in India at HRI Allahabad, TIFR Mumbai and CMI Chennai also pursue related research. For more information on summer programs, refer to </span><span class="c5">(link)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c12">6. Does CPI matter in applying to different internships and projects?</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c12 c10">C.P.I. contributes since it is the only quantitative measure of your academic performance, but it is not the only factor. Don&rsquo;t let a low CPI stop you from reading up on current research and forming opinions. Intelligent mails, creative research proposals might go a long way, probably further than your CPI.</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">8. Is there any eligibility criterion for applying to foreign universities for the summer? When should we apply? </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c10 c13">Every individual fellowship has its own prerequisites, so if you fulfill them you should apply. Most fellowships do not accept first year students. You should start working on your application from September onwards.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">23.</span><span class="c3 c8">&nbsp; </span><span class="c12">I would like to know about the possibility of a project in experimental physics involving the nature of light.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">Dr. &nbsp;KP Singh works with LASERs at IISER Mohali. It would be a nice idea to pursue summer research in his lab. If you are particularly interested in exploring the wave nature of light you may express this interest to him in the event you apply to him. One may also apply to various research institutes in India and abroad and explore the profiles of various faculty members who may be working with LASERs. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">24. Can the institute arrange more summer exchange programs?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10 c0">&nbsp;The opportunity cell is trying to coordinate with summer internships with various research institutes. At present, we have such an arrangement with NCBS, Bangalore and we look forward to generating more.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">25. Can the opportunity cell provide some assistance for picking a summer project on the basis of one&rsquo;s past projects?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10 c0">This can be dealt with at the level of the subject student coordinators of the Opportunity Cell and they should be contacted regarding the same. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c0">Math</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">1.</span><span class="c3 c8">&nbsp; </span><span class="c12">&rdquo;I am interested in applied mathematics but here we are taught pure mathematics so I don&rsquo;t want to take math major.&rdquo; Could you clarify the difference between &ldquo;pure&rdquo; and &ldquo;applied&rdquo; math, if any? &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">(FORWARD TO KAPIL)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5"><br>2. Summer internship (industry)<br></span><span class="c0">2.</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Can I get an industrial internship in Shell, ONGC, or any other pharmaceutical company?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">3.</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Is an industrial internship helpful if I am interested in PhD or a research oriented career?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10 c0">An industrial internship is helpful if you wish to pursue a research oriented job in the industry, in the sense that it will give you a feel for the career at the industry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">4.</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Are research internships in chemical industry possible?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10 c0">Yes. You can apply to BASF, Shell etc. </span><span class="c10 c9 c0">(link)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">3. Alternate opportunities in Science</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">1.</span><span class="c3 c8">&nbsp; </span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I have a KVPY fellowship. Even though I am interested in biology, I am a bit confused about my career, because I would like to pursue an alternative career in science, other than a research oriented career.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">The KVPY fellowship has certain criteria - CPI 6.0, a summer project </span><span class="c5 c10">specifically in science</span><span class="c12 c10">, and a report every year. You will continue receiving the fellowship till you fulfill these criteria. If you want to spend your summers doing projects in other non-science fields, you run the risk of them objecting and cancelling your fellowship. It makes sense to use your winters pursuing non science options, and dedicating 6-8 weeks of your summers to pure science research and keeping your fellowship. There are many less demanding work-from-home internships in journalism and editing that you can manage with your semester if you so want. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">2.</span><span class="c3 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I am a second year student and am not sure I want to pursue a Ph.D. I am interested in mathematics and computer programming. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">Since you know what you&rsquo;re interested in, pursue it. Second year is too early to discard any options.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5"><br>4. Graduating batch<br></span><span class="c0">13.</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">I would like to do my 5th year project outside I.I.S.E.R. Mohali, can I?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">No. Institute policy does not allow you to.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">a.

Research Oriented Job information</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">7.</span><span class="c3 c8">&nbsp; </span><span class="c12">I am open to exploring topics in math and physics. I am not sure about pursuing a Ph.D. and want information about research job opportunities in the industry. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">We are currently compiling a list of research oriented job and summer opportunities in the industry and labs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">8.

But the opportunity cell will assist in the process of applications to certain industry oriented careers as long as they require your knowledge of pure science.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5"><br>5.

Help.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">IISER Mohali is a research institute, and the opportunity cell creates opportunities in research. It is a good idea to explore them before discarding this as a career option. Research oriented careers can also be pursued after Masters at the industry. It is not necessary that you pursue a PhD. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">25.</span><span class="c3 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;I am confused because I have lost my interest in Science. I have not decided yet what I should do in future.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">Don&rsquo;t lose heart. You&rsquo;re in IISER for a few more years, interest fluctuates. All it takes is a good summer experience to decide otherwise. Also, talk to seniors. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5"><br></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">6.

PhD student in Chemistry but my focus is in cell biology and biochemistry. What should I do?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">IISER encourages interdisciplinary research, so you&rsquo;re in the right place. You might want to talk to Dr Samrat Mukhpadhyay who also trained in chemistry but whose research is in biology.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">MS10/09</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c0">Questions we couldn&rsquo;t/ don&rsquo;t want to answer</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">Well the answer is, it depends. Here are our suggestions if you are interested in these three options;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">a. Academic career : If you want to pursue your career in academia, it is a good idea to stay back and try to improve your score since CPI is a criterion for selection to PhD programmes. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">b. Research oriented job: A good job in industry is hard to find and is competitive. A good CPI increases your chances of selection. Do an industry internship, if you know you can improve your CPI next semester. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">c. Non science careers: Find your career. Determine if they require a general aptitude test or a &nbsp;degree and CPI matter. For instance, if you want to do civil services, prepare for it right away - your CPI does not matter. However, If you want a good job or be called for any interview, CPI would matter. Also, in careers like MBA etc, CPI is taken as a factor for interview. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c7"><span class="c10 c0">Alternatively, you can do a project in IISER, since you are assured one, and this should not be looked on as an inferior option. If you want to apply for an internship abroad, the funding is competitive, and a good option would be to wait for a year and improve your CPI.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">7. If I give the interested topic, could you please help to find the guide and institute.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">If you have an interested topic, we can tell you how to use Google to find out who work in them. It makes sense to browse through institutes&rsquo; faculty pages and isolate PIs. Alternatively, contact IISER faculty that work in the interested topic and ask them for current labs best suited to an interested second year student.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">7.</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">How to approach a professor for recommendation?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10 c0">&ldquo;Sir/Ma&rsquo;am, I was wondering if you could help me out with a recommendation for summer applications.&rdquo; Or send them an email asking them when you can drop by, for you need a recommendation. Or call them up.

I like physics as well. I am very confused.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">Many people who are majoring in biology currently did not have it in +1 and +2. That should not be a factor. Try to use your summer projects to find out how practical research in biology and physics is different from the theory. Read the syllabus. Talk to majors belonging to either stream.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">24.</span><span class="c3 c8">&nbsp; </span><span class="c12">Why the credits given to theory subjects are more than labs?? Shouldn&rsquo;t both have same credit??</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c10">Wait for your majors, and your labs and theory courses will have equal credits. As to &lsquo;why&rsquo;, we have no idea.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12">10. As my experience in IISER Mohali says, we haven&rsquo;t been exposed to &ldquo;Research&rdquo; methods in Physics as compare to Biology and Chemistry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">1.</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Why don&rsquo;t we have enough well-paid job opportunities if we are a Physics Major and just have a MS degree?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
